At my institution, and perhaps at others, towards the end of the semester Moodle will decide to display a content dialog for course evaluations *every time* you click a page. This becomes immensely frustrating when you are overwhelmed and just trying to access course documents. This is a poor design choice, as full page content dialogs that can't be light dismissed should be reserved for things that require *immediate* user attention (not course evals). And they most definitely shouldn't display on every single page the user clicks. Luckily, there is an easy way to stop these dialogs for good using an ad blocker. 

Most ad blockers are equipped with a function that allows filtering specific html elements, which is what we will be using here. Personally, I use uBlockOrigin, but any capable ad blocker can do the same thing. For uBlockOrigin, open Moodle, click the extension, then click the gear icon. Navigate to filters, and add the following.

```
moodle.rose-hulman.edu##.ek-modal-content
moodle.rose-hulman.edu###ek-overlay
```
This is how it should look.

And that's it, you'll never have to deal with one of those pesky pop-ups again. Until they update Moodle, that is.
