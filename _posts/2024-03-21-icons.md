A fun feature Windows offers is the ability to set an accent color across the system. This color shows up on buttons, icons, selection indicators, and other areas. Recently, multi-colored icons have been used more frequently throughout Windows and other applications as well. These icons, however, always use a static foreground color (usually bright blue). I find this boring, so a while ago I developed icons that use the user's accent color as the foreground. I developed this in the Files for Windows app, and it's still in use today.

The way I went about doing this was using font icons. By splitting up a single icon into two separate glyphs, and then stacking them on top of each other, you could create the appearance of a single icon. The difference, however, is that you can change the colors of the two glyphs as much as your heart desires. 

In order to create the font file, I used FontForge. This allowed me to create a custom font family with these custom glyphs and export them into a ttf that I could load into an app.

When merged in an application, the icons look like this:

Naturally, this updates depending on the users accent color, even if it changes while the app is running. 

The code to implement this in an XAML project looks like this. 
```xml
<FontIcon FontFamily="{StaticResource ColoredIconFontFamily}" Glyph="{x:Bind BaseLayerGlyph, Mode=OneWay}" />
<FontIcon
    FontFamily="{StaticResource ColoredIconFontFamily}"
    Foreground="{ThemeResource ColoredIconOverlayForeground}"
    Glyph="{x:Bind OverlayLayerGlyph, Mode=OneWay}" />
```

One thing you need to look out for, however, is that when the icon is put in a button, the color needs to change based on the state. For example, in a toggle button, the icon will disappear when clicked because the background will end up matching the foreground (WinUI buttons change to the accent color when clicked). Without this change, it's also not possible to tell when a button is disabled as the foreground doesn't change on its own. A hacky way to fix this issue is to find the parent ContentPresenter on load, and add an event handler for when the foreground changes.

```cs
// register a property change callback for the parent content presenter's foreground to allow reacting to button state changes, eg disabled
var p = this.FindAscendant<ContentPresenter>();
if (p is not null)
{
    foregroundChangedToken = p.RegisterPropertyChangedCallback(ContentPresenter.ForegroundProperty, ForegroundChanged);
}
```

In the handler I then check which brush is being used, and update the colors accordingly. For example, if the button's foreground has been set to the disabled color, then the button has most likely been disabled and the colors need to be adjusted. In my XAML, I set up visual states that tweak the color of the icons, for example making the icon darker when disabled.


```cs
private void ForegroundChanged(DependencyObject sender, DependencyProperty dp)
{
    Brush v = sender.GetValue(dp);
    if (v == Resources["AppBarButtonForegroundDisabled"])
    {
        VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, "Disabled", true);
    }
    else if (v == Resource["AppBarToggleButtonForegroundChecked"] || v == Resources["AppBarToggleButtonForegroundCheckedPressed"])
    {
        // for toggle buttons
        VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, "Checked", true);
    }
    else
    {
        VisualStateManager.GoToState(this, "Normal", true);
    }
}
```

This method isn't foolproof, however, as these brushes are specific to AppBarButtons. If the icon was slapped into a normal button this wouldn't work because they use a separate set of buttons. However, changing the check is fairly simple.
